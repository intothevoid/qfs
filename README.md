Quake From Scratch

The idea behind this project is to build Quake - the game engine, the subsystems, everything from scratch. The original Quake source code is available at https://github.com/id-Software/Quake

Thanks to Philip Buuke for his great tutorials and insight. This project will take a fair bit of time to complete but I hope to do it anyway.
